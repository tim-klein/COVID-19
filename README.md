# COVID-19
This python script reads the latest data from the [John Hopkins University repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) regarding the spread of the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19.
The number of confirmed cases per country is plotted versus time and normalized by the total population of each country. This approach should be more relevant than plotting absolute numbers of cases in order to assess the risk level of infection.
